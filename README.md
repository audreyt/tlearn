# TLearn

This Drupal 7 module offers an online courseware platform, based on the original
design of Art Tsai for 通通學 (TotoLearn, based on Drupal 6).

Compared to TotoLearn, this new version offers following improvements:

* Flexible video playback compatible with CloudFront, on-site and third-party
  video hosting (YouTube, etc.).

* Out-of-box integration with Ubercart 3, with convenient APIs for alternate
  payment systems such as Drupal Commerce.

* A flexible permission model supports role-based and user-based authorization.

* Courses are organized into chapter & sections; each section may offer
  distinct views for guests, members and authorized users.

Currently the message strings are Traditional Chinese only; we're in the process 
of internationalizing the module, as well as offering more documentation in
both English and Traditional Chiense.

The original author of this module is Art Tsai (@arttsai), distributed under GPL
version 2 or later; the current maintainer is Audrey Tang (@audreyt).
